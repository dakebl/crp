We do not store cookies on your computer unless it is strictly necessary
for the functions of the website you have chosen to use. In those cases
we will still not store cookies on your computer without informing you
first and giving you the opportunity to avoid having us do so. When
we do store a cookie on your computer it will contain only the minimum
information necessary for the operation of the site, typically an
anonymous identifier and some information used for automatic login if
you have requested that feature.
