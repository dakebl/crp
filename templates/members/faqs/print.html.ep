When you're printing documents it's important that they come out on the paper exactly as they
were designed. To make that reliable, the documents you can download from this site for printing
are provided in a standard format called PDF (Portable Document Format). You should find that
your normal web browser can display and print these files reliably but if you have problems
you should try

</p>
<p>
PDF documents will normally appear in your browser window, just like web pages. You can then
print them in the same way as other pages, usually by pressing Ctrl-P or Cmd-P. Alternatively
you can save them on your computer so that you can print them with another piece of software
such as the PDF reader suggested above or you can send them to someone else, e.g. a commercial
print shop, to have them printed. Saving a displayed document is usually done by pressing
Ctrl-S or Cmd-S.
</p>
If you are printing documents yourself you need to make sure that the settings are right so that
the documents print out at the right size. Most documents are intended to be printed on standard
A4 size paper unless their descriptions say otherwise.
Some things to watch out for:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure scaling is turned off. If there is a specific scale option, make sure it's
    set to '100%' or 'None'.</li>
    <li>If there are options like 'Scale to fit' or 'Automatic scaling' or 'Fit to page', make sure
    those options are turned off.</li>
    <li>If you have a colour printer then make sure coukour printing options are turned on.</li>
    <li>If your printer can print double-sided then make sure that option is turned on. Where
    the documents have multiple pages they are designed to be printed on both sides of the paper
    unless their descriptions say otherwise.</a>
</ul>
<h2>Business Cards</h2>
<p>
Among the documents available from the site is a selection of business cards that you can
print out to give to people. These are designed to fit onto very specific card stock that
has very fine perforations so that you can separate the cards from the A4 sheet and produce
a professional result. There are several options available and they should be easily available
from most stationery suppliers. Here are some examples:
