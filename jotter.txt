** published courses need cancel links
** published courses should be editable to some extent. Not date.
** Add live courses to instructor's personal page
** Leaflet printing for live courses

** templates/members/profile.html.ep gets lat/long defaults from params instead of profile. Is that right? Where else does this happen?

- New materials for instructors course:
    - Timetable?
    - Booking form (personal details, payment).
    - Pre-course booking acknowledgment with details of what to bring, where to come, when to arrive.
    - Homework assignment handouts to take away during the course (colouring?).
    - Homework assignment handouts to take away after the course.
    - Peer/self assessment forms for microteach.
    - Disruption cards for microteach exercise.
    - Reflective practice log.

+ Limit numbers in search results. Enquiries - find near location, notify_enquirers.
+ Fix up members' menu
    + Add a suitable set of options
    + Add IDs to the pages so that the options highlight properly
    + Change the background or somehow make the members' area obviously different?
+ Refactor templates to further generalise location input.
+ Booking form PDF has payment details on it
+ Cookie doesn't get deleted on log-out
+ handle auto-login flag
+ use named paths in menus (and elsewhere)
+ First visit to enquiry page is slow to load: jquery? gmaps?
+ production error 500 page
+ Adding a new enquiry should notify instructors of nearby courses if requested
+ Check if session methods really need to have $c as first param
+ Login/auth logic from spreadsheet
+ Session table housekeeping (see enquiry housekeeping)
+ Get rid of all references to Tutor/practitioner
+ Login routes to test: from logged out, from logged out via interstitial, from already logged in, from already logged in via interstitial
+ add some decoration to the contact form and the thank you page (etc etc)
+ tests!!
+ Move validation to a plug-in?
+ Publishing a course could take a long time to notify all the enquirers.

++ Handle accounts for unqualified instructors (with no current certificate record) - what are the restrictions?
    + No certificates
    + Can't add a course
    + Can't use the shop?
    + Can't get (most?) PDFs
    + Not included in CRP::Controller::Main::tutor_list 
    + Others?

+ Certificate management
    + Database table with: certificate_id, instructor_id, issue_date, life_time, type, version, issuer_id, instructors_name, revocation_date, revoker_id
        - Type is for course certificates and renewal certificates (and maybe others at some point)
        - Version is so we can have different PDFs over time and reprints will still use the originals
        - issuer_id is for the trainer that issued the certificate and is duplicated for automatic renewal. NULL means Sue!
        - instructors_name is recorded in case it changes after issue, so the original certificate can be reproduced
    + When an instructor qualifies or they qualify for certificate renewal, add a row to the certificate table.
    + Facility to produce a PDF of the certificate with an electronic signature encoding the certificate_id, including a QRcode, with or without scan of issuer's manual signature
    + Development system marks certificate as sample
    ~ Certificates can be checked easily by going to a URL that includes the certificate's electronic signature
        ~ Page shows certificate details (or message saying it's not valid)
        ~ Link to instructor's personal page
    + Instructors can easily get a PDF copy of their most recent renewal certificate by a link in their control panel
    + Administrators can create and revoke certificates
    + Administrators can get PDFs of certificates without the scanned issuer's manual signature, for the issuer to actually sign

 Workflow notes
 --------------
 + DB changes:
    + Modify lib/CRP/Model/Schema/Result/*
    + Update version number in lib/CRP/Model/Schema.pm
    + check status - run: ./script/crp migrate status
    + run: ./script/crp migrate prepare
    + check new autosql files like: share/deploy/migrations/PostgreSQL/upgrade/1-2/001-auto.sql
    + if any tweaks are needed:
        + copy new autosql to one or more numbered sql files in the same directory
        + tweak as required
        + remove 001-auto.sql
    + run: ./script/crp migrate upgrade




Formulae to find a long and lat a given distance and bearing from another:
    - LAT2 = asin( sin LAT1 * cos Ad + cos LAT1 * sin Ad * cos BRNG )
    - LONG2 = LONG1 + atan2( sin BRNG * sin Ad * cos LAT1, cos Ad - sin LAT1 * sin LAT2 )
    - Ad is angular distance travelled = distance / earth's radius = distance(km)/6371
    - BRNG is the bearing, clockwise from north
    - We're interested in vertical and horizontal distances only so special cases of these formulae.
    - Care needed near the poles where vertical displacment may cross over and horizontal may wrap.
    - There are 111.045km per degree of latitude
    - There are cos(lat)*111.045km per degree of longitude
