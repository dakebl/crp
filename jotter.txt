+ Add some sort of monitoring

+ Is there a memory leak somewhere? PDF rendering?
    - There does seem to be - we occasionally get failures because there's not enough memory to fork a child process
    - Removing the etag handler doesn't seem to help
    - Apparent association with fetching PDFs seems to be just because they are large content. Happens with other things but less obviously. Process grows by amount related to size of fetched document.
    - Looks like this happens in Morbo as well as Hypnotoad
    - Possibly this is just normal memory consumption. Limting the number of connections before restarting has helped anyway.

        + A web page can be generated for each news letter - maybe several, geographically split, or a universal one
        + An index of newsletters will allow Google to find them
        + Each new article can also be a new blog post
        + Articles are not necessarily directly CRP related
        + Similar approach for generating and maintaining instructors' newsletters
    + Log out
 
 + Possible feature to track course assessments
    - On intial sign-up, each new instructor must do some post-training assessments by certain dates
    + Each assignment has a description, a response from the assessor, and a 'done' flag
    + Instructor's home page reminds them to complete assignments
    + Administrators can mark assignments done
    + Administrators get warning emails when assignments are (in danger of) running late
    + Instructors accounts are eventually disabled if assignments not completed
    + Administrators can extend due dates on assignments
    + Administrators can add new assignments at any time
 
 + Could each instructor have their own shop which earns them commission? (accounting problems? liability? perhaps they just earn credit)
 
 
 Workflow notes
 --------------
 + DB changes:
    + Modify lib/CRP/Model/Schema/Result/*
    + Update version number in lib/CRP/Model/Schema.pm
    + check status - run: ./script/crp migrate status
    + run: ./script/crp migrate prepare
    + check new autosql files like: share/deploy/migrations/PostgreSQL/upgrade/1-2/001-auto.sql
    + if any tweaks are needed:
        + copy new autosql to one or more numbered sql files in the same directory
        + tweak as required
        + remove 001-auto.sql
    + run: ./script/crp migrate upgrade
- Making PDFs in Xara
    - Choose email/web download
    - In advanced options, choose PDF v1.3 for Adobe Reader 4
- Making PDF thumbnails
    - Load test PDF into Chrome
    - Zoom to 75%
    - Snip and copy to clipboard
    - Paste into Xara
    - Set units to pixels
    - Move to pixel boundary
    - Cut out desired part (A4 is evidently 595x840px at 75%)
    - Scale result to 25% and move to pixel boundary
    - Export as JPG with same name as PDF but .jpg extension
 - Releasing a new version
    - Make sure release note is updated (use relnote script): templates/members/faqs/updates.html.ep
    - Tag name is release-YYYYMMDD-NN
    - run: git tag <tag-name>
    - run: git push origin <tag-name>
    - log in to the vultr server
    - run: su - crp
    - run: cd crp
    - run: ./upd
    - NB: The upd script just pulls the latest version of whatever branch is checked out, not necessarily the right tag.
