 Workflow notes
 --------------
 + DB changes:
    + Modify lib/CRP/Model/Schema/Result/*
    + Update version number in lib/CRP/Model/Schema.pm
    + run: ./script/crp migrate prepare
    + check new autosql files like: share/deploy/migrations/PostgreSQL/upgrade/1-2/001-auto.sql
    + if any tweaks are needed:
        + copy new autosql to one or more numbered sql files in the same directory
        + tweak as required
        + remove 001-auto.sql
    + run: ./script/crp migrate upgrade




Formulae to find a long and lat a given distance and bearing from another:
    - LAT2 = asin( sin LAT1 * cos Ad + cos LAT1 * sin Ad * cos BRNG )
    - LONG2 = LONG1 + atan2( sin BRNG * sin Ad * cos LAT1, cos Ad - sin LAT1 * sin LAT2 )
    - Ad is angular distance travelled = distance / earth's radius = distance(km)/6371
    - BRNG is the bearing, clockwise from north
    - We're interested in vertical and horizontal distances only so special cases of these formulae.
    - Care needed near the poles where vertical displacment may crss over and horizontal may wrap.
